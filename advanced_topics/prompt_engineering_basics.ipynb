    "## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique where you instruct the model to think step by step before giving the final answer. Instead of expecting the answer directly, the model explains its reasoning, which improves accuracy, especially for multi-step problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why it works:\n",
    "- LLMs are good at pattern recognition but sometimes skip reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By asking them to \"show reasoning,\" you guide the model to simulate logical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Useful for math problems, logic puzzles, reasoning tasks, or any task requiring multiple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How CoT Works\n",
    "Instead of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Q: If there are 3 apples and I buy 2 more, how many apples do I have?\n",
    "A: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Q: If there are 3 apples and I buy 2 more, how many apples do I have? Show your reasoning.\n",
    "A: \n",
    "Step 1: Start with 3 apples.\n",
    "Step 2: Buy 2 more apples.\n",
    "Step 3: Total apples = 3 + 2 = 5\n",
    "Answer: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the model breaks the problem into steps before answering. This makes it more accurate for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Design a CoT Prompt\n",
    "Key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicitly ask for reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Words like: \"Explain your reasoning,\" \"Step by step,\" \"Show how you got the answer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide examples (few-shot) if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Helps the model understand how to format reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keep instructions clear and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Don't mix multiple goals in one prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Guide the format of output (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Like \"List steps 1, 2, 3, and then give final answer.\"\n",

    "### What is Reflexion?\n",
    "Reflexion is a technique where the AI **tries something**, **checks if it worked**, **reflects on what went wrong**, and **tries again** with improvements. It's like learning from your mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a student taking a test:\n",
    "- **Without Reflexion:** Submit answer, move on (might be wrong)\n",
    "- **With Reflexion:** Submit answer → Check if correct → \"Ah, I forgot to handle negative numbers!\" → Fix and resubmit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need This?\n",
    "- First attempts are often imperfect\n",
    "- LLMs don't naturally \"check their work\"\n",
    "- Reflexion adds a **self-improvement loop**\n",
    "- Significantly improves code generation and reasoning tasks\n",

    "## 1. Input Encoding (Tokenization)\n",
    "Every word (and even part of a word) is broken into tokens. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"Gokul\", \"was\", \"an\", \"AI\", \"Engineer\", \"working\", \"in\", \"southern\", \"part\", \"of\", \"India\", \"located\", \"in\", \"Coimbatore\", \".\", \"He\", \"has\", \"5\", \"years\", \"experience\", \"in\", \"the\", \"field\", \"of\", \"Python\", \"along\", \"with\", \"AI\", \".\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But most transformers use subword tokenization (like Byte-Pair Encoding or WordPiece), so it may look like this internally:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"Gokul\", \"was\", \"an\", \"AI\", \"Engineer\", \"work\", \"##ing\", \"in\", \"south\", \"##ern\", ..., \"Coim\", \"##bato\", \"##re\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    " Why Subword? Helps handle new words, rare names, or spelling variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  2. Token Embeddings\n",
    "Each token is converted into a dense vector (say, 768 dimensions) using an embedding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Gokul\" → [0.12, -0.44, ..., 0.87]\n",
    "\n",
    "These embeddings capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contextual usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic closeness (e.g., \"Engineer\" and \"Developer\" are near in space)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Positional Encoding\n",
    "Since transformers don't have loops, position of each token is added (e.g., whether \"Gokul\" came first or last).\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gokul - 1\n",
    "was - 2\n",
    "an - 3\n",
    "AI - 4\n",
    "Engineer - 5\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Passing Through Transformer Layers\n",
    "The embedded and position-aware tokens pass through multiple transformer blocks, each with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-Attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Looks at all other tokens to figure out what to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    → For \"He\", the model attends to \"Gokul\" to know who \"He\" refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feedforward Layers:\n",

    "    Adds non-linearity and complexity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\"He has 5 years experience\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The attention mechanism sees:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"He\" → highly connected to \"Gokul\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"5 years\" → connects with \"experience\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Experience\" → strongly linked to \"Python\" and \"AI\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Final Representation\n",
    "After all transformer layers, each token has a contextual vector representing not just the word but its meaning in that sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"AI\" in \"AI Engineer\" has a different vector than \"AI\" in \"along with AI\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Output (Based on Task)\n",
    "Depending on your goal, this final vector is used:\n",
    " - For summarization: The whole sentence vector is pooled and shortened.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For question answering: The model picks the answer span.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For understanding intent or generating a reply (as I do): The next tokens are predicted using all this context."
