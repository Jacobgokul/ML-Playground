    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment, making decisions, and getting rewards or penalties as feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal = learn the best strategy (policy) to maximize total rewards."

    "- Dynamic Programming (DP): Uses Bellman equations, works only when environment is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monte Carlo Methods: Learn from many episodes by averaging rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal Difference (TD): Learn step by step (mix of DP + Monte Carlo).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q-Learning: Learns a table of best actions for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SARSA: Similar to Q-learning but updates using the action actually taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Uses neural networks instead of tables (good for complex environments like games).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy Gradient Methods: Learn policies directly instead of Q-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actor-Critic: Combines value-based + policy-based approaches for faster learning."
